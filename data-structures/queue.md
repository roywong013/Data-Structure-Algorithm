# Queue

Queue can be build by either array or linked list. However, <b>linked list</b> will be more efficient as queue always need to remove item in first index. <br>
<b>Linked List:O(1) Array:O(n)</b>

| Enqueue | Dequeue | Peek | Lookup |
|---------|---------|------|--------|
| O(1)    | O(1)    | O(1) | O(n)   |
