# Queue

Queue can be build by either array or linked list. However, linked list will be more efficient as queue always need to add item in first index. <br>
<b>Linked List:O(1) Array:O(n)</b>

| Enqueue | Dequeue | Peek | Lookup |
|---------|---------|------|--------|
| O(1)    | O(1)    | O(1) | O(n)   |
