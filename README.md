# Data-Structure

>This repository is for learning Data Structure, such as <b>array</b>, <b>linked list</b>.

### Big O:
Big O is the upper bound of algorithm time complexity <b>(worst case)</b>. Big O have 4 rules in interview as below:
1. Worst Case
2. Remove Constant
3. Different terms for inputs (e.g. O(m+n))
4. Drop non Dominants 
  * (Only take the most significant, e.g. O(n^2+8n+2000)  =>  O(n^2))
