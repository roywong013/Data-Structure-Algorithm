# Recursion

> <b>Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.</b>

Recursion means that a function that call itself. When we using a tree or doing some sorting, we can consider using recursion for make it easily for coding.
Be careful that recursion can cause stack overflow.

1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and <b>return</b> when needed. Usually you have to <b>return</b>.
